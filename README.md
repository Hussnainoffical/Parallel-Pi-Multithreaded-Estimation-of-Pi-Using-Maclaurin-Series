# Parallel-Pi: Multithreaded Estimation of Pi Using Maclaurin Series

## 📘 Project Overview

This project implements a multithreaded approach to estimate the value of π using the **Maclaurin series for arctangent(1)**:

> π ≈ 4 × (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...)

The computation is parallelized using **POSIX threads (pthreads)** with proper synchronization through **mutex locks** to avoid race conditions and ensure thread-safe access to shared memory.

Developed as a **Complex Computing Problem (CCP)** for the course **Operating Systems (CC3011)** at the **University of Management and Technology**.
